Please see `test_human-AI.html` and all the JavaScript code used there to understand how I implemented experimental games where humans play with an AI agent.

The experiment has four conditions: 1p1g, 1p2g, 2p2g, and 2p3g.

I would like you to implement a human-human version, where in 2p2g and 2p3g, humans play with another human player in real-time.

You can set up a configuration file so I can choose whether to use the human-AI or human-human version.

Please do not change any of my existing code and logic; instead, create new files.
