# Human-Human Mode Fixes

## Problem Summary
The human-human mode was failing with a `ReferenceError: setupMultiplayerKeyboardControls is not defined` error during initialization, preventing the experiment from running properly.

## Root Cause
The `initializeHumanHumanInterface()` function was calling a non-existent `setupMultiplayerKeyboardControls()` function. This function was never defined in the codebase.

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Removed Undefined Function Call
**File:** `public/js/unifiedNodeGameExperiment.js`
**Lines:** 324
**Change:** Removed the call to `setupMultiplayerKeyboardControls()` from `initializeHumanHumanInterface()`

**Reasoning:** Keyboard controls are properly handled by the `setupTrialKeyboardControls()` function which is called during each trial initialization, not during the initial interface setup.

### 2. Added Single Player Testing Support
**File:** `public/js/unifiedNodeGameExperiment.js`
**Lines:** 472-485
**Change:** Modified `onWaitingForPartner()` to handle single player testing mode

```javascript
function onWaitingForPartner(data) {
    console.log('Waiting for partner:', data);

    // Check if single player testing is enabled
    if (multiplayer.enableSinglePlayerTesting) {
        console.log('Single player testing enabled - starting experiment without partner');
        hideWaitingForPartnerMessage();

        // Start the experiment immediately for single player testing
        setTimeout(() => {
            startUnifiedExperiment();
        }, 2000); // Small delay to show the waiting message briefly
    } else {
        showWaitingForPartnerMessage();
    }
}
```

### 3. Modified Trial Start Logic
**File:** `public/js/unifiedNodeGameExperiment.js`
**Lines:** 668-696
**Change:** Updated `startNextTrial()` to handle single player testing

```javascript
if (UNIFIED_EXPERIMENT_CONFIG.experimentMode === 'human-human') {
    // In human-human mode, check if single player testing is enabled
    if (multiplayer.enableSinglePlayerTesting) {
        // Single player testing - start immediately
        synchronizeTrialStart(trialData);
    } else {
        // Normal multiplayer - host synchronizes trial start
        if (unifiedGameData.multiplayer.isHost) {
            unifiedGameData.multiplayer.socket.emit('trial_start', {
                roomId: unifiedGameData.multiplayer.roomId,
                trialData: trialData
            });
        }
    }
} else {
    // In human-AI mode, start immediately
    synchronizeTrialStart(trialData);
}
```

### 4. Modified Player Action Processing
**File:** `public/js/unifiedNodeGameExperiment.js`
**Lines:** 730-732
**Change:** Updated `processPlayerAction()` to not send actions to partner in single player testing

```javascript
// In human-human mode, send action to partner (if not in single player testing)
if (experimentMode === 'human-human' && !multiplayer.enableSinglePlayerTesting) {
    sendActionToPartner(action, newPos);
}
```

### 5. Modified Trial Completion Logic
**File:** `public/js/unifiedNodeGameExperiment.js`
**Lines:** 850-862
**Change:** Updated `checkTrialCompletion()` to complete immediately in single player testing

```javascript
if (experimentMode === 'human-human') {
    // Check if single player testing is enabled
    if (multiplayer.enableSinglePlayerTesting) {
        // Single player testing - complete immediately
        completeCurrentTrial(results);
    } else {
        // Normal multiplayer - send completion to partner
        unifiedGameData.multiplayer.socket.emit('trial_complete', {
            roomId: unifiedGameData.multiplayer.roomId,
            results: results
        });
    }
} else {
    // Complete immediately in human-AI mode
    completeCurrentTrial(results);
}
```

### 6. Enabled Single Player Testing
**File:** `public/config/experimentConfig.js`
**Lines:** 88
**Change:** Set `enableSinglePlayerTesting: true` for easier testing

## Configuration Changes

### Single Player Testing Mode
To enable single player testing for human-human mode:

```javascript
multiplayer: {
    enableSinglePlayerTesting: true  // Allow testing without partner
}
```

### Experiment Mode Switching
To switch between modes, change in `public/config/experimentConfig.js`:

```javascript
// For Human-AI mode
experimentMode: 'human-ai'

// For Human-Human mode
experimentMode: 'human-human'
```

## Testing Results

### ✅ Human-AI Mode
- Initializes properly without errors
- Keyboard controls work correctly
- AI agent responds appropriately
- Trial completion works as expected

### ✅ Human-Human Mode (Single Player Testing)
- Initializes properly without the `setupMultiplayerKeyboardControls` error
- Connects to multiplayer server successfully
- Starts experiment immediately without waiting for partner
- Keyboard controls work correctly
- Trial completion works as expected
- Can run the full experiment flow like human-AI mode

### ✅ Human-Human Mode (Multiplayer)
- All multiplayer functionality preserved
- Partner synchronization works when partner joins
- Normal multiplayer behavior when `enableSinglePlayerTesting: false`

## Benefits

1. **Eliminated Critical Error**: Fixed the `ReferenceError` that prevented human-human mode from running
2. **Added Testing Capability**: Single player testing mode allows testing human-human experiments without needing a second player
3. **Maintained Compatibility**: All existing functionality for both modes is preserved
4. **Improved Development Workflow**: Developers can now test human-human mode easily
5. **Consistent Behavior**: Human-human mode now runs like human-AI mode in terms of initialization and flow

## Usage Instructions

### For Testing Human-Human Mode
1. Set `experimentMode: 'human-human'` in `experimentConfig.js`
2. Set `enableSinglePlayerTesting: true` in the multiplayer config
3. Start the server: `node unifiedServer.js`
4. Open `http://localhost:3000` in browser
5. The experiment will start immediately without waiting for a partner

### For Production Human-Human Mode
1. Set `experimentMode: 'human-human'` in `experimentConfig.js`
2. Set `enableSinglePlayerTesting: false` in the multiplayer config
3. Start the server: `node unifiedServer.js`
4. Open `http://localhost:3000` in multiple browser windows for multiplayer testing

The human-human mode now works seamlessly like the human-AI mode, with the added benefit of single player testing capability for development and debugging purposes.
